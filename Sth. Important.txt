Dear friends,

Hi, this is“月亮MovieMonthly”，a social self-media in China. I hope this request finds you well. 
We focus on sharing information about film festivals around the world and introducing the festival culture to readers. 
PÖFF really impressed me for its uniqueness and artistic style. Since last year, we've made a collation of PÖFF's programme in Douban. And we were happy to see that three Chinese films ("Stars Await Us" & "Great Happiness" &  "Love Song 1980") were selected last year, and it's also a delight to find the film "Who is Sleeping in Silver Grey" will be having a world premiere in the coming weeks in Tallinn. 

Here are our previous report on Sarajevo Film Festival, Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Venice Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, etc.

2021 marks PÖFF's 25th birthday, it's a good chance for us to cover the major events to Chinese filmlovers.
